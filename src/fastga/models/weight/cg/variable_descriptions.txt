# Documentation of variables used in FAST-GA models
# Each line should be like:
# my:variable||The description of my:variable, as long as needed, but on one line.
# The separator "||" can be surrounded with spaces (that will be ignored)

# For the computation of the center of gravity coordinates of the different components certain axes need to be selected:
# X-axis: body axis that goes positive from the nose to the tail of the airplane
# Y-axis: perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the airplane, positive towards the tip of the right wing.
# z-axis: contained in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft and perpendicular to the x-axis, positive upwards.
